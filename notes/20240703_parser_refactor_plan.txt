Parser Refactor Plan
1. refactor the include .h files and interfaces in header, to make parser's architecture more clear.
    - internal functions do not write in .h files, and they should be static
    - internal structs and enums do not write in .h files
    - interface which supplies to outside of Pika Kernel should begin with 'Pika'
    - name of structs or functions should obey the specific rule (especially those in .h files)
        > struct: Name (use typedef)
        > enum: enum Name (content: NAME_TYPE_1)
        > function: parser_do_something
        > macro: NAME_DO_SOMETHING
        > variable: linux_style_var (and do not use '_' prefix unless it's obsolete)
2. rename the interface
3. clean redundant logic
4. refactor the parser's architecture
